## 前言

本篇博客整理了**系统级程序设计课程**中的`lecture6`.

- A Trigram Game
- Practical Hints

### Measurement and Profiling

#### Time Scale

![1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMSnow/SLP-Notes/master/pic/5/1.png)

- Computers operate on two fundamentally different time scales.

- At a microscopic level

  To execute instructions at a rate of one or more per clock cycle, where each clock cycle requires only around one nanosecond (abbreviated “ns”)

- On a macroscopic scale

  processor must respond to external events that occur on time scales measured in milliseconds (abbreviated “ms”).

#### Process Scheduling and Timer Interrupts

**[简答题]** interval time

#### Measuring Time by Interval Counting

间隔计数.

- **[简答题]** time segment

  - The operating system also uses the timer to recordthe cumulative time used by each process.
  - This information provides a somewhat imprecisemeasure of program execution time.
  - A **time segment** refers to the period during whichjust one process executes.

  `time prog -n 17`

- **[简答题]** time mechanisms

- Profiling

### Hot Spots

#### Hot Spot

The 80/20 Rule

- 80% of the CPU time is spent in 20% of the program
- These places where the computer spends most of its time are also called hot spots,inner loops, and kernels.

#### Amdahl's Law

![1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RMSnow/SLP-Notes/master/pic/5/5.png)

- All programs have hot spots.
- A little effort can have large payoffs.
- If only part of a program can be sped up with parallel processing, then thesequential part of the program woulddetermine and limit the possible speed up.
- Knowing how to optimize is an importantskill. Knowing when to stop optimizing isalso important.



P34 A Trigram Game？？？

### Practical Hints

#### Some Expensive Operations

- `printf()`
  - `printf()` causes **malloc** to be called in the usual implementation, adding an unexpected cost
  - String manipulation is expensive, whether it is formatting text as in printf, reading ASCII text andconverting to numbers, or performing stringcomparisons.
  - Modern computers are designed to accessmemory a word at a time. Accessing a character is no faster than accessing a word, and may be slower.
  - String operations usually operate one character ata time, i.e strlen(), has to examine every character,one at a time.
- `malloc()`
  - use static or local variables to avoid allocating memory on the heap.
  - keep a list of objects that need to be allocated often => explicit free-list.
  - Then, allocation is just a matter of removing an object from the list, and freeing simply inserts the object on the list.
- `new()`

#### Example

P45-48 ？？？

#### Fast Allocation and Free
