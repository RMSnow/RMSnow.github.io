### Memory Systems

#### Memory Technology

- Categories
  - Static Random Access Memory(SRAM)
  - Dynamic Random Access Memory(DRAM)
  - Magnetic disks
  - Magnetic tapes
  - Optical disks

- Computers use memory technologies of varying size and speed to achieve both acceptable speed and size at an affordable cost.

- Access Time: SRAM < DRAM < Mag Disks

  Cost: SRAM > DRAM > Mag Disks

- **[简答题]**

  This scheme of taking advantage of several memory technologies to get both speed and size is called a memory hierarchy.

#### Locality of Reference

The immediate future will be similar to the immediate past and that memory addresses that have been accessed recently are likely to be accessed again.

- Spatial and Temporal Locality
  - References to a single address occurclose together in time (this is calledtemporal locality).
  - References to addresses that are nearto each other occur together in time(this is called spatial locality).

- It is a property of programs, not of computers.

  Program's locality is a property of the program's behavior, and not of the computer.

- Code Examples

#### Memory Hierarchies

- Typical computer designs have at least four levels in the hierarchy.
  - Registers are closest to the CPU, are smallestin size, and are also the fastest memory in thesystem

  - Furthest from the CPU is the disk, where largeinactive parts of programs sleep for long periods of time

  - In between: caches & main memory

    - The policy decisions for these levels are made as the program executes.

    - The computer has special cache hardware that moves data from memory to cachesand vice versa。
